# Minimal API Versioning
This project demonstrates how to implement and manage multiple API versions in a .NET Core Web API using minimal APIs.

## Overview
API versioning is essential for maintaining a stable and adaptable API. It allows you to:
- **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Ensure existing clients continue to function correctly even with new API versions.
- **Facilitate Smooth Transitions**: Allow clients to upgrade to newer versions at their own pace, minimizing disruptions.
- **Manage Changes Effectively**: Introduce improvements and new features while keeping the existing API stable

## Development Prerequisites
Before diving into development with this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- **Development Environment**: Either Visual Studio (IDE) or Visual Studio Code (Source-code editor)
- **.NET 8 SDK**: Required framework version for building and running the project

## Getting Started
To run the API locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred development environment.
3. Build and run the project using the appropriate commands or methods for your development environment.
